	* sparsehash: initial release:
	  The sparsehash package contains several hash-map implementations,
	  similar in API to SGI's hash_map class, but with different
	  performance characteristics.  sparse_hash_map uses very little
	  space overhead: 1-2 bits per entry.  dense_hash_map is typically
	  faster than the default SGI STL implementation.  This package
	  also includes hash-set analogues of these classes.
